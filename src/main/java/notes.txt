A Program to demonstrate the use of @PathVariable annotation:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ApplicationController1.java
* ApplicationController2.java
Notes:
* The @PathVariable annotation is used to extract values from web request and bind them to method arguments.
* The @PathVariable annotation can be supported at parameter level only.
* This annotation can accepts attributes, those are value, name and required.
* The value and name attributes are used to bind the path variable, if value and name is not defined the path variable should match the method argument.
* The required annotation is used to make path variable to mandatory and non mandatory, it accept value as boolean and default value of required attribute is true.
* The count of path variable should match with web request, other wise it return '404 â€“ Not Found'
